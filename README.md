# ✈️ Airport Operations Analysis (SQL & Python)

This project analyzes **airport operational data** using SQL and Python to uncover insights related to:
- Passenger trends  
- Flight frequency  
- Seat utilization  
- Route performance  
- Seasonal behavior  
- Airport traffic patterns  
- Longest/shortest routes  
- Year-over-year demand changes  

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** for improving operational efficiency, resource allocation, and strategic planning for airlines and airports.
